# How to Visualize the Graph

# Family Tree Data
This section describes the structure of the data in the ´family_graph.json´ file. What information is included for each family member? How are relationships represented?

Example structure of family_graph.json:

{
  "family_members": [
    {
      "name": "Father",
      "children": ["Child1", "Child2"],
      "father": null,
      "mother": null
    },
    // ... other family members
  ]
}
